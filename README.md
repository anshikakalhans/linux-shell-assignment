# linux-shell-assignment
Project Overview

This project focuses on learning and documenting basic Linux usage as part of my assignment. I worked with a Linux environment (Ubuntu) and explored how to install it, how to use the terminal, and how to perform different shell commands. The aim of this project was to understand the Linux filesystem, navigate through directories, manage files, check system information, and practice commonly used commands that are required for beginners.

As a part of the assignment, I also documented installation steps, hardware configuration, and screenshots of the Linux setup. Along with that, I performed and explained 20 different shell commands, including file navigation, file management, permissions, process monitoring, and networking. The project helped me understand how Linux works internally and how to use the command line more confidently.

Instructions for Running the Scripts

Open the Terminal in Linux.

Go to the folder where your script is saved:

cd folder_path


Give permission to the script (you have to do this only once):

chmod +x scriptname.sh


Run the script:

./scriptname.sh


If the script needs any inputs, run it like this:

./scriptname.sh input1 input2

The output will appear in the terminal. If any error comes, check the file name, path, or permissions again.



Brief Description of Each Script
Script 1: Backup a Directory (backup.sh)

This script creates a backup of a selected directory. It copies all the files and folders into a new backup folder with a timestamp. It is useful for saving important data and practicing directory handling in Linux.

Script 2: CPU/Memory Monitoring (monitor.sh)

This script checks the system’s current CPU and memory usage. It displays real-time system statistics and helps understand how to monitor system performance using basic Linux commands.

Script 3: Automated Download Task (download.sh)

This script automatically downloads a file from a given URL using commands like wget or curl. It helps automate the downloading process and shows how to work with network-related commands in Linux.
